# Restfull-API-using-retrofit-in-kotlin-with-validation
Search Book App
This is a search book app built using the MVVM architecture pattern, Room database, and Retrofit. The project provides a Restful API implementation in Kotlin and includes a validation mechanism to ensure the correctness of the data inputted into the API. It serves as an ideal resource for developers who aim to build efficient and reliable API services.

Features
Search Book: The app allows users to search for books by entering keywords. It sends the search query to the API and displays the results in a user-friendly interface.

MVVM Architecture: The project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, separating the concerns of data management, UI presentation, and user interaction. This design promotes code reusability, testability, and maintainability.

Retrofit: Retrofit is utilized to handle the communication with the RESTful API. It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and processing the responses. Retrofit offers flexibility and extensibility, making it an excellent choice for API integration.

Room Database: The app incorporates a local Room database to store and retrieve data, ensuring offline availability and improved performance. The database seamlessly synchronizes with the API to provide users with up-to-date information.

Data Validation: The project includes a robust data validation mechanism to ensure that the data inputted into the API is correct. This helps maintain data integrity and provides a reliable user experience.

Prerequisites
Before running the app, ensure that you have the following:

Android Studio installed on your machine.
An Android device or emulator running Android API level 21 or higher.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the app up and running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/SamantSumanDev/Search-Book-App-MVVM-and-Retrofit.git

2. Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing project."

3. Navigate to the cloned repository and select the project directory.

4. Wait for Android Studio to build the project and download any necessary dependencies.

5. onnect your Android device or start an emulator.

6. Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio, and select your device/emulator to install and launch the app.

Configuration
To configure the app for your specific needs, you may need to make the following adjustments:

• API Base URL: If the API you are using has a different base URL, you can modify it in the 'ApiService.kt' file located in the app/src/main/java/com/example/searchbookapp/api directory.

• API Key: If the API requires an API key for authentication, you can add it to the ApiService.kt file as well.

• Data Validation Rules: Depending on your specific data validation requirements, you can modify the validation rules in the corresponding ViewModel or model classes.
